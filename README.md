FILE NAME: FAKE ACCOUNT DETECTION FROM OSN
INTRODUCTION:The proliferation of online social networks OSN has led to an increase in the
creation of fake accounts, which pose significant risks to user security, data integrity,
and trust within these platforms. This report presents a comprehensive approach
to detecting fake profiles using a combination of machine learning algorithms like
logistic regression and network analysis techniques. We analyze user behavior
patterns, profile characteristics, and social interactions to identify anomalies
indicative of fraudulent activities. Our methodology incorporates supervised and
unsupervised learning models, leveraging features such as account age, frequency
of posts, and engagement metrics. We validate our model using a dataset of known
fake and legitimate accounts, achieving high accuracy and precision. The results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the overall security of OSN,
providing insights into potential mitigation strategies for platform administrators.
This study underscores the importance of proactive measures in combating the
challenges posed by fake profiles in the digital landscape.We evaluate the modelâ€™s
performance on a robust dataset, achieving significant improvements in detection
accuracy and recall. The findings highlight the potential for real-time monitoring
and intervention, offering OSN platforms valuable tools to safeguard their user
communities and enhance overall platform integrity. This work contributes to the
ongoing discourse on online security and the necessity for adaptive solutions in an
ever-evolving digital. This process involves identifying and mitigating accounts
that are created with fraudulent. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, data
mining techniques, and behavioral analysis, effective detection systems analyze
various features such as user activity patterns, account creation metadata, and social
network behaviors. By employing techniques like logistic regression, decision
trees, and neural networks, these systems can classify accounts as genuine or fake
with high accuracy. This not only enhances user experience but also safeguards
platforms against malicious activities, thereby promoting a safer online environment.
Continuous adaptation and improvement of detection algorithms are essential to
counter evolving tactics used by fake account creators.
